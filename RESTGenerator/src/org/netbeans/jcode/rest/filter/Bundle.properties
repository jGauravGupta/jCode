REST.fiter.PRE_MATCHING.title = Pre Matching Container Request
REST.fiter.POST_MATCHING.title = Post Matching Container Request
REST.fiter.CONTAINER_RESPONSE.title = Container Response
REST.fiter.CLIENT_REQUEST.title = Client Request
REST.fiter.CLIENT_RESPONSE.title = Client Response

REST.fiter.PRE_MATCHING= Pre-matching filters are executed before the incoming HTTP request is mapped/dispatched to a Java method.
REST.fiter.POST_MATCHING= Post-matching filters are executed by the JAX-RS container only after the completion of method dispatch/matching process. Unlike, pre-matching filters, these filters do not need an explicit annotation i.e. filter classes without the @PreMatching annotation are assumed to be post-matching by default
REST.fiter.CONTAINER_RESPONSE= A server side Response filter is invoked by the runtime after a response (or an exception) is generated by the JAX-RS resource method (before dispatching the same to the caller/client).
REST.fiter.CLIENT_REQUEST= Client side request filters are invoked after the HTTP request creation before it is dispatched to the server.
REST.fiter.CLIENT_RESPONSE= Client side response filters are invoked after the HTTP response has been received from the server end but before it is dispatched to the caller/client. It provides an opportunity to mutate the properties of the HTTP response (Headers, Cookies etc).
